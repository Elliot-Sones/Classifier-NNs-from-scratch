# Building Neural Networks from scratch

Neural Networks are the foundation of modern machine learning so I wanted to build and push my understanding of Neural Networks and explain every step process and more. 

My goal was to build a simple MLP classification for digits 0-9 . Then push my understanding by implementing a CNN for classifying digits 00-99. 


# Simple Mutli-Layered Perceptron (Digits 0-9) 
[Try the MLP here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Eli181927/elliot_digit_classifier?logs=container)

For detailed implementation and results, see the [MNIST README](MNIST/README.md). 


# Convolutional Neural Network (Digits 0-99)
[Try the CNN here]()

For detailed implementation, explanation and results see the [MNSIT-100 README](MNIST-100/README.md)
